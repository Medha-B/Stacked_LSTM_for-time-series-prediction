# Stacked_LSTM_for-time-series-prediction
We create a Stacked LSTM model by stacking multiple hidden LSTM layers, one on top of another.
These LSTM layers usually require a 3 dimensional input and LSTMs by default will produce a 2 dimensional output as an interpretation from the end of the sequence.
This code is written for Univariate time series prediction, on the framework of Keras and Tensorflow.
